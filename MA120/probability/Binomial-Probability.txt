P(S) = probability of success.  The numerical value is p, so P(S) = p.
P(F) = probability of failure.  The numerical value is q, so P(F) = q.
n = the number of trials.
p = the probability of success in one of the n trials
q = the probability of failure in one of the n trials
X = the number of successes in n trials
P(X) = the probability of getting exactly X successes among the n trials
